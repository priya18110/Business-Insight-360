# Business Insights 360 â€“ Power BI Project

Business Insights 360Â° is a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates key business data from Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive Management into a single platform. 
It delivers actionable insights through KPI tracking, profitability analysis, forecast accuracy metrics, and market share trends, helping stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Summary

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing tech company, aimed to shift from intuition-based decisions and static Excel reports to a more data-driven approach.
My objective was to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides leadership with a comprehensive 360Â° view of key operational, marketing, and financial performance metrics.
